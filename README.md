# Midjourney-Input-Functions
A 512-bit and 256-bit version of a Python program that deterministically converts cryptographic public keys and hints to a sentence string for AI image generation. This project was motivated for the purpose of producing NFT art for _Pauli Group's_ post-quantum cryptographic challenges. 

The program begins by inputting Python's built-in Math module, as well as the contents of the separate, list-containing file. This IPYNB notebook houses extensive lists, ranging from two bits to twenty bits in length. Each list corresponds to a particular genre of terms; that is, adjectives, nouns, adverbs, styles, emotions, and more. Some lists are entirely numerical, which are later referenced as image weightings, seed values, and stylize values.
